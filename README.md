# CaseShare


## Introduction

### The Project

Welcome to CaseShare. CaseShare is a social platform that allows healthcare professionals to connect and collaborate.
Doctors and the whole healthcare team experience a lot of things in relation to their responsibilities. They experience 'aha' moments, ecstacy, and sometimes doubt. There are things they wished they knew; things they wish they would do differently if given another chance.
However, many of these experiences stay personal, or local. This is a problem because many healthcare professionals have something to share, but they don't have a platform to do that. As a result, their experiences stay personal, or local within an institution, and other colleagues is different institutions may find themselves reinventing the wheel.
We hereby propose CaseShare, a solution that allows healthcare professionals across different institutions to come together and collaborate. This tool will allow them to connect to each other, ask questions that other colleagues can answer, discuss cases, message each other, and so much more.
CaseShare will enable healthcare practitioners from different institutions to leverage each other’s knowledge, like the way StackOverflow helps developers.
This tool will not support patient transferring, and shall not be used to hold any patient’s data that can be traced back to them. All images shared should be de-identified for patient privacy.
We believe this project is relevant to the development of medicine and quality of care offered in Africa.

### Installation
To run the Case Share Website locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

https://github.com/mphokekana/CaseShare

2.  To create a virtual environment on a Linux system, you can follow these steps:

Open a terminal window.

Install the python3-venv package if it's not already installed. You can do this by running the following command:

sudo apt-get install python3-venv

Create a directory where you want to store your virtual environment. For example, you can create a directory called "myenv" by running:

mkdir myenv

Navigate into the directory using the cd command:

bash
Copy code
cd myenv
Create a new virtual environment by running the following command:

python3 -m venv env

This will create a new directory named "env" inside your "myenv" directory, which will contain the virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment by running the activation script:

source env/bin/activate

After running this command, you should see that your prompt has changed to indicate that you are now inside the virtual environment.

You can now install Python packages and work within the virtual environment. Any packages you install will be isolated to this environment and won't interfere with your system-wide Python installation.

To deactivate the virtual environment and return to your normal shell, simply run the following command:

deactivate

Then install requirements from requirements.txt file

Update pip

pip install --upgrade pip

pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run code

Python -m flask run

Open your web browser and visit (http://localhost:5000) to access the CaseShare website.

### Usage



### The Context

This is a Portfolio Project concluding 9 months of Foundations in Software Engineering at Holberton School - ALX.
We were tasked to come up with a project we wanted to work on, and went through 3 rounds of reviews by our peers. The MVP was developed in 14 days from 19 May 2023 to 1 June 2023.
